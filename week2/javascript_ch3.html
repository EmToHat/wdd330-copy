      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>An array is an ordered list of values.</p>
      <p class="code-block">
        const myArray = [];
        <br />
        << []
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        const myArray = new Array();
        <br />
        << []
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        typeof []
        <br />
        << 'object'
      </p>

      <h3>Sets</h3>
      <p>
        Sets were introduced to the specification in ES6. A set is a data
        structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot
        include any duplicate values. They are similar in concept to a
        mathematical set, although (for the time being at least) they don't
        contain mathematical set operations such as union, intersection and
        product.
        <br />
        Sets offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if
        any values have been duplicated. It's also quick and easy to check if a
        particular value is in a set, which can be a slow operation if an array
        is used.

      <h3>Maps</h3>
      <p>
        Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification.
        They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and
        are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other
        programming languages.

      <h3>Logic</h3>
      <p>
        In this section, weâ€™ll begin to look at logical conditions that allow
        you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of
        code, depending on the results of certain operations.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // if statements
        <br />
        if (condition) {
        <br />
        // whatever code that is in here will run if condition is true
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // if else statements, if the condition is false ELSE will run
        <br />
        if (condition) {
        <br />
        // whatever code that is in here will run if condition is true
        <br />
        } else {
        <br />
        // this code will run if the condition is false
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // Switch operator, The switch operator can be used to make your code easier to follow when there are lots of conditions to test. 
        <br />
        switch (number) {
        <br />
        case 4:
        <br />
        console.log('You rolled a four');
        <br />
        break;
        <br />
        case 5:
        <br />
        console.log('You rolled a five');
        <br />
        break;
        <br />
        case 6:
        <br />
        console.log('You rolled a six');
        <br />
        break;
        <br />
        default:
        <br />
        console.log('You rolled a number less than four');
        <br />
        break;
        <br />
        }
      </p>

      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>Loops will repeat a piece of code over and over again according to certain conditions.</p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // While Loop, this loop repeatedly runs a block of code while a certain condition remains true.
        <br>
        // This loop will be infinite unless a condition is met at some point. The code could be stuck if there isn't a stopping condition.
        <br>
        while (condition) {
          <br>
          // code to be executed
          <br>
        }
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // For loops are the most common loop in JS.
        <br>
        for (initialization ; condition ; after) { 
          <br>
          do something 
          <br>
        }
