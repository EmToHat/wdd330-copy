        <b>Arrays</b>
        <br /><br />
        An array is an ordered list of values.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        const myArray = [];
        <br />
        << []
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        const myArray = new Array();
        <br />
        << []
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        typeof []
        <br />
        << 'object'
      </p>

        <b>Sets</b>
        <br /><br />
        Sets were introduced to the specification in ES6. A set is a data
        structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot
        include any duplicate values. They are similar in concept to a
        mathematical set, although (for the time being at least) they don't
        contain mathematical set operations such as union, intersection and
        product.
        <br />
        Sets offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if
        any values have been duplicated. It's also quick and easy to check if a
        particular value is in a set, which can be a slow operation if an array
        is used.

        <b>Logic</b>
        <br /><br />
        Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification.
        They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and
        are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other
        programming languages.

        In this section, weâ€™ll begin to look at logical conditions that allow
        you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of
        code, depending on the results of certain operations.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // if statements
        <br />
        if (condition) {
        <br />
        // whatever code that is in here will run if condition is true
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // if else statements, if the condition is false ELSE will run
        <br />
        if (condition) {
        <br />
        // whatever code that is in here will run if condition is true
        <br />
        } else {
        <br />
        // this code will run if the condition is false
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // Switch operator, The switch operator can be used to make your code
        easier to follow when there are lots of conditions to test.
        <br />
        switch (number) {
        <br />
        case 4:
        <br />
        console.log('You rolled a four');
        <br />
        break;

        break;
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Loops</b>
        <br /><br />
        Loops will repeat a piece of code over and over again according to
        certain conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // While Loop, this loop repeatedly runs a block of code while a certain
        condition remains true.
        <br />
        // This loop will be infinite unless a condition is met at some point.
        The code could be stuck if there isn't a stopping condition.
        <br />
        while (condition) {
        <br />
        // code to be executed
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // For loops are the most common loop in JS.
        <br />
        for (initialization ; condition ; after) {
        <br />
        do something
        <br />

        <b>Defining a Function</b>
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // To define a function literal, we use the function declaration
        <br />
        function hello() {
        <br />
        console.log('Hello World!');
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // Another way of defining a function literal is to create a function
        expression. This function is an anonymous function because it doesn't
        have a name.
        <br />
        const goodbye = function(){
        <br />
        console.log('Goodbye World!');
        <br />
        };
        <br /><br />
        // But you can create a named function also
        <br />
        const goodbye = function bye(){
        <br />
        console.log('Goodbye World!');
        <br />
        };
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // A function can also be declared using constructor Function(). The
        body of this function is entered as a string.
        <br />
        const hi = new Function('console.log("Hi World!");');
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Invoking a Function</b>
        <br /><br />
        Invoking the function will run the code inside the function's body. In
        order to invoke the function you enter it's name followed by
        parentheses.
        <br>
        The function can be invoked over and over again just by typing its name
        followed by parentheses.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        hello();
        <br />
        << 'Hello World!'
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Return Values</b>
        <br /><br />
        All function RETURN a value, this can be specified when using the return
        statement. Any function that doesn't specifically say return will return
        undefined by default.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        function howdy() {
        <br />
        return 'Howdy World!';
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Parameters & Arguments</b>
        <br /><br />
        Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably
        to represent values provided for the function as an input.
        <br>
        These two terms do have a difference but it is subtle. Any parameters a
        function needs are set when the function is defined. But when the
        function is invoked, the function is provided with arguments.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Callbacks</b>
        <br /><br />
        Functions can be given as a parameter to other functions. When a
        function is passed as an argument to another function this is known as a
        callback.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        function sing(song) { 
          <br>
          console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}`);
          <br>
        }
        <br>
        sing('Let It Go') 
        <br>
        << 'I'm singing along to Let It Go'
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        function sing(song, callback) { 
          <br>
          console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);
          <br>
          callback();
          <br>
        }
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Array Iterators</b>
        <br /><br />
        Arrays have a number of methods that utilize callbacks to make them more flexible.
        <br>
        Arrow functions are frequently used to declare the callbacks, this because they are short functions, often only taking up one line, making them a good candidate for using the arrow notation.
