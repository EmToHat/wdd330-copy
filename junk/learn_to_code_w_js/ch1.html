      <p class="card-text">
        <span>Programming</span> is about making computers do what you want them
        to do. A computer program is basically a series of instructions that
        tell your computer how to perform a task. Unfortunately, computers donâ€™t
        speak the same language as us.

      <p class="card-text">
        <span>Algorithm</span> is a Latinization of the name of a Persian
        mathematician, Al-Khwarizmi, who wrote the first algebraic textbook and
        liked to explain his methods using a step-by-step approach. This led to
        the word algorithm being used to describe any step-by-step method.

        <span>Algorithm for a cup of tea:</span>
        <br /><br />
        1. Boil water in a kettle.
        <br />
        2. Get a cup.
        <br />
        3. Get a teabag.
        <br />
        4. Put the teabag in the cup.
        <br />
        5. When the kettle has boiled, pour the water into the cup.
        <br />
        6. Leave it to brew for two minutes.
        <br />
        7. Take the teabag out of the cup.
        <br />
        8. Get milk.
        <br />
        9. Add milk to the tea.
        <br />
        10. Stir the tea.

      <p class="card-text">
        Those instructions seem fairly basic and straightforward, but there are
        quite a few assumptions made, and some steps are a bit ambiguous. How do
        you boil a kettle? Where do you get the cup and teabag from? How much
        water should I pour into the cup? These questions are left unanswered.
        This is usually okay, as most people are familiar with the process of
        making tea, but someone who had never seen a cup of tea being made might
        struggle to follow some of the steps (although I accept that it might be
        very hard to find such a person).

        <span>Pseudocode</span> is pretend code you can write to illustrate what
        a program does without having to worry about the complexities of an

        structure of a program and uses precise commands, but without the
        specifics of a language.

        A programmer who knows a how to program in a specific language should be able to follow a pseudocode example and then write it in their language of choice. Pseudocode is useful for planning out a program before you start coding, and it also makes it easier to share ideas between programmers who use different programming languages.
