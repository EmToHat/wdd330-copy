        <h2>CH2: Programming Basics</h2>
        <p>
          Comments are ignored by the program, but make your program easier to
          read and understand Data types are the basic building blocks of all
          JavaScript programs. 
          <br><br>
          There are six primitive data types: strings,
          symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null. 
          <br><br>
          Non-primitive data
          types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of
          'object'. 
          <br><br>
          Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared
          using the const or let keywords. 
          <br><br>
          Values are assigned to variables
          using the = operator. 
          <br><br>
          Strings and numbers have various properties and
          methods that provide information about them. 
          <br><br>
          Symbols are unique,
          immutable values. 
          <br><br>
          Boolean values are either true or false. 
          <br><br>
          There are
          only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as
          'falsy' values. 
          <br><br>
          Data types can be converted into other data types.
          <br><br>
          Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another
          data type in order to perform an operation.
          <br><br>
          Logical operators can be
          used to check if compound statements are true or false. 
          <br><br>
          Values can be
          compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other
          values.

        <h2>CH3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays: An ordered list of values. To create an array use the syntax: const myArray = [];
          <br><br>
          Sets: were introduced in ES6. They are a data structure which represents a collection of unique values, it can't have any duplicate values. To create a set use the syntax: const list = new Set();
          <br><br>
          Converting Sets to Arrays: A set can be converted into an array by placing the set w/the spread operator directly inside an array literal.
          <br><br>
          Maps: Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.
          <br><br>
          Logical conditions allow you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of code, depending on the results of certain operations. (e.g. if statements)
          <br><br>
          Loops: repeat a piece of code over and over again according to certain conditions. (e.g. while(condition){})
        </p>

      <div class="topic">
        <h2>CH4: Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Define a Function: There are a number of ways to define a function in JavaScript. Three of the most common are covered below. ES6 introduced a new way to define functions, using what is known as 'arrow' notation. 
          <br>
          (e.g. 
          <br>
          Function declarations: const goodbye = function(){}
          <br>
          Function expressions: const goodbye = function bye(){}
          <br>
          Function() Constructors: const hi = new Function('console.log("Hi World!");');
          <br>
          ).
          <br><br>
          Invoke a Function: Invoking a function is to run the code inside the function’s body. To invoke a function, simply enter its name, followed by parentheses. 
          <br><br>
          Return Values: All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes after the return keyword. A function that doesn’t explicitly return anything (such as all the examples we have seen so far) will return undefined by default.
          <br><br>
          Parameters & Arguments: Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.
          <br><br>
          Callbacks: Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.
          <br><br>
          Array Iterators: Arrays have a number of methods that utilize callbacks to make them more flexible.
