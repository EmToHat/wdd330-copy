        <h2>Validating Forms</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="notes">Client-side Form Validation</span>
          <br>
          Before submitting data to the server, ensure that all required form controls are properly filled out in the correct format. 
          <br><br>
          This form helps to ensure that the data submitted will match the requirements made by the various form controls.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Client-side Validation</span>
          <br>
          Is an initial check and is an important feature of good UI (user experience). It catches invalid data on the client-side, which the user can fix straight away.
          <br><br>
          If the data gets to the server-side, it will be rejected and cause a delay going on a round trip to the server and back to the client side.
          <br><br>
          Client-side validation shouldn't be considered as an exhaustive security measure. My Apps should ALWAYS perform security checks on any form-submitted data both on server-side and client-side. 
          <br><br>
          Client-side validation is easy to bypass, so it is easy for malicious users to send bad data to the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Form Validation, what is it?</span>
          <br>
          e.g. Registration Form, the user will recieve feedback when data was entered incorrectly. Messages could be: "This field is required", "Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx", "Please enter a valid email address", "Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number."
          <br><br>
          These are called form validation. When the user enters data, the browser/or web server will check to see if the entered data is correct and will let the user know, especially if the data is incorrect.
          <br><br>
          Client-side Validation: It is validation done in the browser.
          <br><br>
          Server-side Validation: It is validation done on the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Forms</span>
          <br>
          As web developers we want to make filling out web forms as easy as possible for our users. So why is do we insist on validating those forms?
          <br><br>
          There are three MAIN reasons:
          <br>
          1. We want to get the right data, in the right format.
          <br>
          2. We want to protect our users' data.
          <br>
          3.We want to protect ourselves.
          <br><br>
          NEVER TRUST data passed to the server from the client. This includes if the form is validating correctly, a malicious user can stil alter the network request.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Client-Side Types</span>
          <br>
          Client-side has two types: Built-in form validation, and JavaScript.
          <br><br>
          Built-in form validation: uses HTML5 form validation features, this type of validation doesn't usually require too much JS. The built-in form validation has better performance than JS, but it isn't as customizable.
          <br><br>
          JS form validation: is coded using JS. It is completely customizable, but you need to create all the validation or use a library. 
        </p>

        <h2>Using Fetch</h2>
        <p>
          The Fetch API allows a JS interface to access and manipulate parts of the HTTP pipline like requests and responses. 
          <br><br>
          The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in the following significant ways:
          <br>
          The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. 
          <br><br>
          <span class="notes">Basic Fetch Request</span>
          <br>
          fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
          <br>
          .then(response => response.json())
          <br>
          .then(data => console.log(data));
          <br><br>
          The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings.
