        <h2>CH9 | The Window Object</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="notes">The Browser Object Model</span>
          <br />
          Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that
          are created in the global scope are actually properties of this
          object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment
          the global object is the window object, which represents the browser
          window that contains a web page.
          <br /><br />
          The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of
          properties and methods that contain information about the browser and
          computer screen.
          <br /><br />
          popup window
          <br />
          window.alert("hello");
          <br />
          window.confirm("Do you wish to continue?");
          <br />
          window.prompt("Please enter your name: ");
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Browser Information</span>
          <br />
          The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide
          information about the user’s browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">The Browser History</span>
          <br />
          The window.history property can be used to access information about
          any previously visited pages in the current browser session.
          <br /><br />
          The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been
          visited before arriving at the current page.
          <br /><br />
          The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page,
          where 0 is the current page:
          <br /><br />
          window.history.forward()
          <br />
          window.history.back()
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Controlling Windows</span>
          <br />
          A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes
          the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window
          title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third
          parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can
          then be referenced later in the code.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Screen Information</span>
          <br />
          The window.screen object contains information about the screen the
          browser is displayed on. You can find out the height and width of the
          screen in pixels using the height and width properties respectively.
          <br /><br />
          window.screen.height
          <br />
          window.screen.width
          <br /><br />
          The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and
          width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus.
          <br /><br />
          window.screen.availWidth
          <br />
          window.screen.availHeight
          <br /><br />
          The colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit depth of the
          user’s monitor, although there are few use cases for doing this other
          than collecting user statistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">The Document Object</span>
          <br />
          Each window object contains a document object. This object has
          properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded
          into the window. In Chapter 6, we covered the Document Object Model
          and the properties and methods used to manipulate items on the page.
          The document object contains a few other methods that are worth
          looking at.
          <br /><br />
          document.write('Hello, world!');
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Timing Functions</span>
          <br />
          The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the
          execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at
          regular intervals.
          <br /><br />
          The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its
          first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">setInterval()</span>
          <br />
          The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to
          window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the
          callback function after every given number of milliseconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Animation</span>
          <br />
          The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate
          elements on a web page. As an example, let’s create a web page that
          shows a colored square, and make it rotate. Create a folder called
          animation that contains files called index.html, styles.css and
          main.js.

          <br />
          The W3C plans to develop future versions of HTML5 much more frequently
          than previously, using smaller version increments. HTML 5.1 has
          already become the latest standard, and HTML 5.2 is in development.
          You can read more about the new features in HTML5.1 and what to expect
          in HTML 5.2 in this post on SitePoint.

          <span class="notes">The data- Attribute</span>
          <br />
          The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using
          custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also
          private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external
          service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.
          This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook
          that the program utilizes to access information about a particular
          element on the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">HTML5 APIs</span>
          <br />
          The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain
          access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the
          graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently
          introduced to give developers access, and control new features that
          appear in the latest devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Other APIs</span>
          <br />
          The list of APIs is constantly growing, and includes APIs for
          accessing a device’s camera, uploading files, accessing the battery
          status, handling push notifications, building drag-and-drop
          functionality, creating 3D effects with WebGL, and many more! A
          comprehensive list of HTML5 APIs can be found at the Mozilla Developer
          Network.
        </p>

          <span class="notes">Drawing w/Canvas</span>
          <br />
          The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a
          web page in real time using JavaScript. A canvas element is a
          rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate system that
          starts at (0,0) in the top-left corner. To add a canvas element to a
          page, the canvas tag is used specifying a height and width. Anything
          placed inside the tag will only display if the canvas element is
          unsupported.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="notes">Shims and Polyfills</span>
          <br />
          HTML5 APIs progress at a rapid rate ― new APIs are constantly being
          introduced, and existing APIs often change. Modern browsers are very
          quick to update and implement many of the changes, but you can’t
          always guarantee that users will have the most up-to-date browser.
          This is where a shim or a polyfill comes in handy. These are libraries
          of code that allow you to use the APIs as usual. They then fill in the
          necessary code that's not provided natively by the user’s browser.

        <h2>Managing the Modern Front-End Workflow</h2>
        <p>
          Development workflow has become quite complicated for Web development.
          <br><br>
          Medium Sized Project: it could have dozens of js files, css files, libraries, icons, images, etc. 
          <br><br>
          1. Package Managers: These keep track of all of the external dependencies for our app. Both development tools and libraries we might be using. It knows not only which packages to download...but tracks versions as well. We are using npm for our package manager.
          <br>
          2. Bundlers: bundlers handle the compiling, transpiling, concatinating, minifying, and moving around of assets in our project. We are using Parcel as our bundler. Another common bundler is Webpack
          <br>
          3. Task managers: these keep track of what needs to be done and when. There will generally be scripts defined in the task manager for each phase of development. Our project is fairly simple so we are just using npm again for task manager. Other common managers are Grunt or Gulp
