        <b>Comments</b>
        <br /><br />
        Comments are extremely important: well-commented code makes it easier
        for anybody reading your code to understand what is happening in the
        code.
        <br />
        Two types of comments: single line and multi-line comments.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">// this is a single line comment</p>

        /* this is a multi-line comment <br />
        anything in this space will be ignored <br />

        <b>JS Grammar</b>
        <br /><br />
        JS syntax is similar to C programming language.
        <br />
        Two statements, one on each line.
        <br />
        Blocks don't need to be ended with a semicolon.

        <b>Primitive Data Types</b>
        <br /><br />
        JS has 7 different data types, 6 of them are <em>primitive</em> data
        types.
        <br />
        String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, and Null.
        <br />
        <em>Object</em> isn't a primitive data type.
        <br />
        <em>typeof</em> special js operator for finding out the type of value.
        <br />
        <em>Unary</em> operator only requires one operand.
        <br />
        <em>Binary</em> operator two operands.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // Operator is typeof, the string 'hello' is the operand.
        <br />
        <em>typeof</em> 'hello' <br /><br />
        // Operator is + and the numbers 3 and 5 are the operands.
        <br />
        3 + 5
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Variables</b>
        <br /><br />
        Variables are used in programming 2 refer 2 a value stored in memory.
        <br />
        Declare: use the keywords const and let.
        <br />
        const: used when the variable won't be assigned to another value.
        <br />
        let: used when the variable will be assigned to another value.
        <br />
        Use the = operator to assign to const or let.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Naming Constants & Variables</b>
        <br /><br />
        When naming constants and variables, you should try to give them
        sensible names that describe what the variable represents; hence, answer
        is a better variable name than x.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        // camel case

        <b>Strings</b>
        <br /><br />
        A string is a collection of characters, such as letters and symbols. We
        can create a string literal by writing a group of characters inside
        quote marks.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        //this will cause an error
        <br />
        'it's me'
        <br />
        //this will work
        <br />
        "it's me"
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>String Properties & Methdods</b>
        <br /><br />
        Primitive data types and objects have properties and methods. Properties
        are information about the object or value, while methods perform an
        action on the object or value ― either to change it or to tell us
        something about it.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        5 is written as 00000000000000000000000000000101

        <b>Template Literals</b>
        <br /><br />
        Template literals are a special types of string that were introduced in
        ES6. Template literals use the backtick character, `
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Symbols</b>
        <br /><br />
        Symbols were introduced as a new primitive value in ES6. They can be
        used to create unique values, which helps to avoid any naming
        collisions.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Numbers</b>
        <br /><br />
        Numbers can be integers (whole numbers, such as 3) or floating point
        numbers (often referred to as just 'decimals' or 'floats', such as
        3.14159).
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        Number.isInteger(42);
        <br />

        <b>Changing The Value of Variables</b>
        <br /><br />
        If a variable has been assigned a numerical value, it can be increased
        using the following operation:
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        <em>let</em> points = 0;
        <br />
        << 0
        <br /><br />
        points = points + 10;
        <br />
        << 10
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        points += 10;
        <br />
        << 20
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Type Coercion</b>
        <br /><br />
        Type coercion happens when the operands of an operator are of different
        types. Such as a string and a number.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        '2' * 8;
        <br />
        << 16
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        '2' + 8;
        <br />

        <b>Converting Strings</b>
        <br /><br />
        We can convert numbers to strings and vice versa using a variety of
        methods.
        <br />
        To change a string to a number, use the Number method.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        Number('23');
        <br />
        << 23

        typeof answer;
        <br />
        << "number"
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        const answer = +'5';

      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Undefined</b>
        <br /><br />
        Undefined is the value given to variables that have not been assigned a
        value.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Null</b>
        <br /><br />
        Null means 'no value'. It can be thought of as a placeholder that
        JavaScript uses to say "there should be a value here, but there isn’t at
        the moment."
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        10 + <em>null</em>; //null behaves like zero

      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Booleans</b>
        <br /><br />
        There are only two Boolean values: true and false. They are named after
        George Boole, an English mathematician who worked in the field of
        algebraic logic. Boolean values are fundamental in the logical
        statements that make up a computer program. Every value in JavaScript
        has a Boolean value and most of them are true (these are known as truthy
        values).
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Logical Operators</b>
        <br /><br />
        A logical operator can be used with any primitive value or object. The
        results are based on whether the values are considered to be truthy or
        falsy.
        <br />
        Placing the ! operator in front of a value will convert it to a Boolean
        and return the opposite value. So truthy values will return false, and
        falsy values will return true. This is known as negation:
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        !true; //negating true returns false
        <br />
        << false
        <br /><br />
        !0; //0 is falsy, so negating it returns true
        <br />
        << true
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Bitwise Operators</b>
        <br /><br />
        Bitwise operators work with operands that are 32-bit integers. These are
        numbers written in binary (base two) that have 32 digits made up of just
        0 s and 1 s.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Comparison</b>
        <br /><br />
        soft equality ==
        <br />
        when a soft inequality is used, JavaScript doesn't take into account the
        data type and will attempt to coerce the two values to the same type
        when doing the comparison.
        <br /><br />
        hard equality ===
        <br />
        tests for equality but only returns true if and only if they are of the
        same data type
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        answer === 5;
        <br />
        << true
        <br /><br />
        answer === '5';
        <br />
        << false

        <b>Sets</b>
        <br /><br />
        Sets were introduced to the specification in ES6. A set is a data
        structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot
        include any duplicate values. They are similar in concept to a
        mathematical set, although (for the time being at least) they don't
        contain mathematical set operations such as union, intersection and
        product.
        <br />
        Sets offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if
        any values have been duplicated. It's also quick and easy to check if a
        particular value is in a set, which can be a slow operation if an array
        is used.

        <b>Invoking a Function</b>
        <br /><br />
        Invoking the function will run the code inside the function's body. In
        order to invoke the function you enter it's name followed by
        parentheses.
        <br>
        The function can be invoked over and over again just by typing its name
        followed by parentheses.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        hello();
        <br />
        << 'Hello World!'
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Return Values</b>
        <br /><br />
        All function RETURN a value, this can be specified when using the return
        statement. Any function that doesn't specifically say return will return
        undefined by default.
      </p>
      <p class="code-block">
        function howdy() {
        <br />
        return 'Howdy World!';
        <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Parameters & Arguments</b>
        <br /><br />
        Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably
        to represent values provided for the function as an input.
        <br>
        These two terms do have a difference but it is subtle. Any parameters a
        function needs are set when the function is defined. But when the
        function is invoked, the function is provided with arguments.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        <b>Callbacks</b>
        <br /><br />
        Functions can be given as a parameter to other functions. When a
        function is passed as an argument to another function this is known as a
        callback.

        function sing(song) {

        }
        <br>
        sing('Let It Go')

        <b>Array Iterators</b>
        <br /><br />
        Arrays have a number of methods that utilize callbacks to make them more flexible.
        <br>
        Arrow functions are frequently used to declare the callbacks, this because they are short functions, often only taking up one line, making them a good candidate for using the arrow notation.
