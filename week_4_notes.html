        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>
          Forms are a method that are used commonly in web pages. Forms are
          everywhere and most of us use them on our favorite sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forms use the element, form inside < >. The form element contains form
          controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a form is submitted it will be sent to a server where it will be
          processed with PHP or Ruby, two back end programming languages. But it
          is becoming more and more popular to process that information with JS
          a front end language before being sent to the server.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>A Searching Example</h3>
        <img src="images/search_example.png" alt="form example" />
        <a href="search.html">Simple Form Example</a>
        <p>
          This form has a name attribute of search, and it also contains two
          form controls-and input field and a button. The input field allows the
          user to search for info, and the button allows the user to submit the
          query.
        </p>

        <h4>Accessing Form Elements</h4>
        <p>
          DOM had a property called document.forms which returned a collection
          of HTML forms into the document in the order they appeared in the
          markup.
        </p>
        <img src="images/index_notation.png" alt="index notation" />
        <img src="images/index_notation2.png" alt="index notation 2" />
        <img src="images/name_attribute.png" alt="name attribute" />

        <h4>Form Properties and Methods</h4>
        <p>
          Form Objects have many useful properties and methods which can be used
          to interact with forms.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>form.submit()</li>
          <li>form.reset()</li>
          <li>form.action</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Submitting a Form</h4>
        <p>
          Most important form event, this event occurs when the form is
          submitted.
        </p>

        <h4>Form Controls</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>input</li>
          <li>select</li>
          <li>textarea</li>
          <li>button</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>Input Fields</h3>
        <p>
          Input Fields are the most common types of form control, but there are
          several categories for input fields.
        </p>

        <h4>Text Input Fields</h4>
        <p>
          Default type of input field is the text input field. This is used for
          a short piece of text, such as a username.
        </p>
        <p>
          The type='text' attribute isn't required.But it is advised to be used.
          It helps with readability, maintenance and future-proofing.
        </p>

        <h4>Password Input Fields</h4>
        <p>
          input type='password' is used to enter sensitive information such as
          passwords. The characters will be concealed when they are entered into
          this field.
        </p>

        <h4>Checkbox Input Fields</h4>
        <p>
          input type='checkbox' is used to select different options, such as
          checked (true) or unchecked (false). The user may select more than one
          checkbox from the list of options.
        </p>

        <h4>Radio Button Input Fields</h4>
        <p>
          input type='radio' is used for the user to choose only one option from
          the list. Usually a short list of options.
        </p>

        <h4>Hidden Input Fields</h4>
        <p>
          input type='hidden' this type of field isn't displayed by the browser,
          but is does have a value when submitted.
        </p>

        <h4>File Input Fields</h4>
        <p>input type='file' this allows you to upload files.</p>

        <h4>Other Input Types</h4>
        <p>
          There are many new imput types with HTML5 such as number, tel and
          color.
        </p>

        <h4>Text Area</h4>
        <p>
          the textarea element is used to allow the user to enter multiple lines
          of text such as a comment or blog post.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>Form Validation</h3>
        <p>
          Form validation is the porcess of checking whether there is missing
          information for information input incorrectly.
        </p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A required field is completed</li>
          <li>An email address is valid</li>
          <li>A number is entered when numerical data is required</li>
          <li>A password is at least a minimum number of characters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Validation can happen on the client side using JS as well as on the
          other side. JS shouldn't be relied on to validate the data before it
          is saved to a database.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>Disabling the Submit Button</h3>
        <p>
          Another useful technique that can aid usability is to disable the
          submit button if there are errors on the form. If the submit button is
          disabled then no action is taken when it’s clicked. Most browsers will
          also display it in a lighter color to indicate that it cannot be
          clicked on. This prevents users from submitting a form containing any
          errors. A submit button can be disable by added the disabled attribute
          to the input element

      <h2 class="card-title">Ch 12: Object Oriented Programming(OOP)</h2>
      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>OOP</h3>
        <p>
          Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming
          that involves separating the code into objects that have properties
          and methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and
          inheritance.
        </p>

        <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
        <p>
          Juicer Example: Fruit is put into the machine, press the 'on' button
          and out comes the juice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the
          essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, such as the
          'on' button. In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic
          inside an object and making methods available to implement the
          functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s
          done.
        </p>

        <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
        <p>
          Juicer Example: My juicer isn't the only appliance I own that has an
          'on' button, although the way the on button works is slightly
          different for each appliance. My juicer also uses the same electrical
          outlet as other appliances in my kitchen. I can also place various
          types of fruit into it and it still juices them.
        </p>
        <p>
          These examples demonstrate the concept of polymorphism: the same
          process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means various
          objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to
          override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
        </p>

        <h4>Inheritance</h4>
        <p>
          I’d really like the next model up from my juicer, as it can deal with
          more types of fruit and it’s a bit quieter. Even though it has these
          extra features, I’m sure that inside it uses many of the same parts
          that my juicer has. This demonstrates the concept of inheritance:
          taking the features of one object then adding some new features. In
          OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit
          all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its
          functionality by adding new properties and methods.
        </p>

        <h4>Classes</h4>
        <p>
          Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as
          class-based languages. This is because they use a class to define a
          blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of
          that class, and inherit all the properties and methods of the class.
          In my juicer example, the juicer class would represent the design of
          the juicer, and each juicer that’s made on the production line would
          be instances of that class.
