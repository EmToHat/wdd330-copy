      <h2>2.3 Remembering User Info</h2>
      <p>Points to PONDER:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How can I store data so it isn't lost when the application stops?
        </li>
        <li>
          How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?
        </li>
        <li>What can I do to allow the user to communicate?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Points to REMEMBER:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Applications communicate w/the user.</li>
        <li>Computers are <em>STUPID</em>.</li>
        <li>
          Computers can't <em>REMEMBER</em> anything. When an application stops,
          anthing that the computer was working on is <em>GONE</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the application had been designed to store what it was working on,
          that info won't disapear.
        </li>
        <li>OUTPUT = info stored or shared w/the user.</li>
        <li>
          INPUT = info coming in from where it was stored or what the user
          entered.
        </li>
        <li>Techies call this IO (input-output).</li>
        <li>The input tag = allows user to input info.</li>
        <li>The textarea tag = allows the user to input text.</li>
        <li>The title tag = explains what the page will do.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
      <p>Step 01: How to rewire your brain for Mobile First UX</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you
          will focus on the content, and your core functionality....doing it the
          other way around is like putting a marshmellow into a piggy bank..."
          Quote by: Joel Marsh - The Hipper Element
        </li>
        <li>2007 the iphone was introduced.</li>
        <li>Responsiveness doesn't equal mobile first</li>
        <li>Mobile = the new desktop</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Step 02: How to improve UX by understanding Users</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times,
          people don't know what they want until you show it to them."
          <br />
          Quote by: Steve Jobs | Apple
        </li>
        <li>Observe what a user does.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Step 03: Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "The trouble w/software is... it sucks... Software customers...have
          learned to live with mediocre software. We do not count on software to
          be intuitively easy to understand or to work consistently. Instead, we
          make do."
          <br />
          Quote By: Stewart Alsop | Venture Capitalist
        </li>
        <li>Nav Menu placed in the bottom of the mobile application.</li>
        <li>Placement Matters!</li>
        <li>
          Understanding Matters: many users don't know what the hamburger menu
          button is.
        </li>
        <li>Hit your users in the happies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Step 04: Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "[The constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, simplified
          solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have
          to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give you their full attention.
          So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important
          things first. Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity."
          <br />
          Quote By: Luke Wroblewski | Co-Founder of Polar and Bagcheck
        </li>
        <li>Float labels for forms, enable auto fill/ complete on forms</li>
        <li>Passwords, show them but allow the user to hide them too</li>
        <li>Keyboards, bring up the number pad.</li>
        <li>Link phone numbers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Step 05: Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers
          need to stay abreast not only of technological developments but also
          of the way people respond to them."
          <br />
          Quote By: Matt Haig | Author
        </li>
        <li>Before you advertise, research.</li>
        <li>Stop using Pop-ups/Pop-overs.</li>
