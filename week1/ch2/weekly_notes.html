            Points to PONDER:
            <br>
            1. How can I store data so it isn't lost when the application stops?
            <br>
            2. How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?
            <br>
            3. What can I do to allow the user to communicate?
        </p>

            Points to REMEMBER:
            <br>
            1. Applications communicate w/the user.
            <br>
            2. Computers are <em>STUPID</em>.
            <br>
            3. Computers can't <em>REMEMBER</em> anything. When an application stops, anthing that the computer was working on is <em>GONE</em>. 
            <br>
            4. If the application had been designed to store what it was working on, that info won't disapear.
            <br>
            5. OUTPUT = info stored or shared w/the user.
            <br>
            6. INPUT = info coming in from where it was stored or what the user entered.
            <br>
            7. Techies call this IO (input-output).
