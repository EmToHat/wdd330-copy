        <h2>2.3 Remembering User Info</h2>
        <p>
            Points to PONDER:
            <br>
            1. How can I store data so it isn't lost when the application stops?
            <br>
            2. How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?
            <br>
            3. What can I do to allow the user to communicate?
        </p>
        <p>
            Points to REMEMBER:
            <br>
            1. Applications communicate w/the user.
            <br>
            2. Computers are <em>STUPID</em>.
            <br>
            3. Computers can't <em>REMEMBER</em> anything. When an application stops, anthing that the computer was working on is <em>GONE</em>. 
            <br>
            4. If the application had been designed to store what it was working on, that info won't disapear.
            <br>
            5. OUTPUT = info stored or shared w/the user.
            <br>
            6. INPUT = info coming in from where it was stored or what the user entered.
            <br>
            7. Techies call this IO (input-output).
        </p>
        <p>
            The input tag = allows user to input info.
            <br>
            The textarea tag = allows the user to input text.
            <br>
            The title tag = explains what the page will do.

                "The trouble w/software is... it sucks... Software customers...have learned to live with mediocre software. We do not count on software to be intuitively easy to understand or to work consistently. Instead, we make do."

        <p>Step 04: Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                "[The  constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, simplified solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give you their full attention. So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first. Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity."
