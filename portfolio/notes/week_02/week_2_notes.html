        <p>
          Comments
          <ul>
            <li>
              Comments are extremely important: well-commented code makes it easier
              for anybody reading your code to understand what is happening in the
              code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two types of comments: single line and multi-line comments.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          // this is a single line comment
          <br><br>
          /* this is a multi-line comment <br />
          anything in this space will be ignored <br />
          Multi-line comments are great for notes */
        </p>
        <p>
          JS Grammar
          <ul>
            <li>JS syntax is similar to C programming language.</li>
            <li>Two statements, one on each line.</li>
            <li>Blocks don't need to be ended with a semicolon.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

          Primitive Data Types
          <ul>
            <li>
              JS has 7 different data types, 6 of them are <em>primitive</em> data
              types.

            <li>String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, and Null.</li>
            <li><em>Object</em> isn't a primitive data type.</li>
            <li><em>typeof</em> special js operator for finding out the type of value.</li>
            <li><em>Unary</em> operator only requires one operand.</li>
            <li><em>Binary</em> operator two operands.</li>
          </ul>
