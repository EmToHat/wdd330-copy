        <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
        <p>
          Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are
          usually caused by one of the following:
          <br /><br />
          System Error
          <br />
          Programmer Error
          <br />
          User Error
        </p>
        <p>
          Exceptions: An exception is an error that produces a return value that
          can then be used by the program to deal with the error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stack Traces
          <br /><br />
          An exception will also produce a stack trace.
          <br />
          This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point
          where the error occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warnings:
          <br /><br />
          A warning can occur if thereâ€™s an error in the code that isn't enough
          to cause the program to crash.
          <br /><br />
          This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that
          produced the warning may cause the program to continue running
          incorrectly.
        </p>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <p>
          Produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some
          deprecated features.
        </p>
        <p>Code: 'use strict';</p>
        <p>
          Linting Tools
          <br />
          Linting tools such as JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test
          the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feature Detection
          <br />
          The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to
          use feature detection.
        </p>

        <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
        <p>MOST modern browsers have debugging tools.</p>
        <p>Browsers: Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Safari</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>Error Objects</h3>
        <p>
          An error object can be created by the host environment when an
          exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          7 error objects: EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError,
          TypeError, URIError, InternalError.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
        <p>
          When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error
          message. This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and
          fix errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In production, however, it will appear as if the program has crashed,
          which does not reflect well on a ninja programmer.
        </p>

      <div class="card-section">
        <h3>Tests</h3>
        <p>
          Testing is an important part of programming that can often be
          overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as
          it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.
        </p>
        <p>
          A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it
          should. For example, we could test that the squareRoot() function that
          we wrote earlier returns the correct answer
