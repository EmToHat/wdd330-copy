        <h2>CH 11: Further Functions</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In JavaScript, functions are <b>first-class objects</b>. This means they can be passed around in the same way as every other value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom properties: Nothing to stop you from adding yr own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript. For example, you could add a description property to a function that describes what it does. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Memorization: If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property. A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or memoization.
            </li>
            <li>
              All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an object that is provided as an argument.
            </li>
            <li>
              Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain conditions.
            </li>
          </ul> 
        </p>

        <h2>CH 13: AJAX</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</li>
            <li>AJAX is a method not a programming language, which is used for web app. 2 transmit & recieve data from the server at the same time w/o affecting the rest of the web page's content.</li>
            <li>Helps to avoid a required page reload.</li>
            <li>The goal of AJAX is to send small amnts of data 2 the server w/o the need to refresh the page.</li>
            <li>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.</li>
            <li>XML is similar to HTML.</li>
            <li>This markup language is used to encrypt messages to be read by humans and machines.</li>
            <li>
              The web of computers or the internet can be separated into 2 parts: Clients and Servers.
            </li>
            <li>
              A client, such as a web browser, requests a resource (a web page) from a server, then this request is proccessed and sends back a response to the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Resources are usually JSON data or small pieces of text or HTML. 
            </li>
            <li>
              A server, when requesting resources is required when using AJAX. This usually involves using a server-side lang. such as PHP, Ruby, Node.js or .NET which serves the data response following an AJAX request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Basic Usage: Fetch API provides a global fetch() method w/only one mandatory argument, a URL. It is necessary to use catch() to deal with any errors coming from the fetch() method.
            </li>
            <li>
              Response Interface: deals with the object thatâ€™s returned when the promise is fulfilled. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
