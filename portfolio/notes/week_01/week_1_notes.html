        How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?
        <br><br>
        Computers are <em>stupid</em>.
        <br><br>
        Computers can't <em>remember</em> anything. When an application stops anthing that the computer was working on is <em>gone</em>.
        <br><br>
        If the application had been designed to store what it was working on, that info won't disapear.
        <br><br>
        OUTPUT = info stored or shared w/the user.
        <br><br>
        INPUT = info coming in from where it was stored or what the user entered.
        <br><br>
        Techies call this IO (input-output).
        <br><br>
        The input tag = allows user to input info.
        <br><br>
        The textarea tag = allows the user to input text.
        <br><br>
        The title tag = explains what the page will do.

          Step 04: Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms
          <br /><br />
          "[The constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, simplified
          solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have
          to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give you their full attention.
          So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important
          things first. Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity."

          Float labels for forms, enable auto fill/ complete on forms.

          Passwords, show them but allow the user to hide them too.
