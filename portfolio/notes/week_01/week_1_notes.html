          Points to PONDER:
          <ul>
            <li>How can I store data so it isn't lost when the application stops?</li>
            <li>How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?</li>
            <li> What can I do to allow the user to communicate?</li>

            <liComputers are <em>stupid</em>.</li>
            <li>Computers can't <em>remember</em> anything. When an application stops anthing that the computer was working on is <em>gone</em>.</li>

        <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
        <p>
          Step 01: How to rewire your brain for Mobile First UX
          <ul>
            <li>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you
              will focus on the content, and your core functionality....doing it the
              other way around is like putting a marshmellow into a piggy bank..."
              Quote by: Joel Marsh - The Hipper Element</li>
            <li>2007 the iphone was introduced.</li>
            <li>Responsiveness doesn't equal mobile first.</li>
            <li>Mobile = the new desktop</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 02: How to improve UX by understanding Users
          <ul>
            <li>"It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times,
              people don't know what they want until you show it to them."
              Quote by: Steve Jobs | Apple</li>
            <li>Observe what a user does.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 03: Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design
          <ul>
            <li>
              "The trouble w/software is... it sucks... Software customers...have
              learned to live with mediocre software. We do not count on software to
              be intuitively easy to understand or to work consistently. Instead, we
              make do." Quote By: Stewart Alsop | Venture Capitalist
            </li>
            <li>Nav Menu placed in the bottom of the mobile application.</li>
            <li>Placement Matters!</li>
            <li>Understanding Matters: many users don't know what the hamburger menu
              button is.</li>
            <li>Hit your users in the happies.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 04: Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms
          <ul>
            <li> 
              "[The constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, simplified
              solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, people often have
              to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give you their full attention.
              So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important
              things first. Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity." Quote By: Luke Wroblewski | Co-Founder of Polar and Bagcheck
            </li>
            <li>Float labels for forms, enable auto fill/ complete on forms.</li>
            <li>Passwords, show them but allow the user to hide them too.</li>
            <li>Keyboards, bring up the number pad.</li>
            <li>Link phone numbers.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 05: Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience
          <ul>
            <li> 
              "End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers
              need to stay abreast not only of technological developments but also
              of the way people respond to them." Quote By: Matt Haig | Author
            </li>
            <li>Before you advertise, research.</li>
            <li>Stop using Pop-ups/Pop-overs.</li>
          </ul>

          My brain is so confused with how to access the object inside an array.
          Is it similar to JSON?
